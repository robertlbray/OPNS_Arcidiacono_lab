estimatePrimitives<-function(d, max.age=12, beta=.98, s.val=c(1, 2)){
  #Inputs: 
  #d: a data.frame d that gives the number of times a bus was replaced in period x.t.
  #max.age: point at which cost stops increasing.
  #s.val: potential values for the s parameter. Like Arcidiacono, we suppose these values are known.
  #beta: discount factor that we assume is known
  #Output: This function saves the MLE estimates of the theta cost parameters and the pi.s unobserved state distribution estimates to 'MLEests.txt'
